## Introduction

In this blog entry I will use data from Web of Science to draw the
network of collaboration in the field of Machine Learning. I am going to
disentangle the core universities that have published the top highly
cited `2878` articles about Machine Learning in Web of Science. These
are the most important scientific contributions to the field downloaded
in October 2022.

I use data of Web of Science which is the most widely used database of
research publications and citations. Most universities have a license to
use this database for research purposes. My query is simple, I use the
multidisciplinary Web of Science Core collection searching on the
publication’s Tittle, Abstract or Keywords the word “Machine Learning”.
Later I filter subsetting only the highly cited publications in the
field.

## Libraries

``` r
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(svglite)
```

    ## Warning: package 'svglite' was built under R version 4.2.1

``` r
library(igraph)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'igraph'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     decompose, spectrum

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     union

## Data

``` r
csvs <- dir(pattern = "savedrecs.*csv$")
csvs <- lapply(csvs, fread)
csvs <- rbindlist(csvs)
dim(csvs)
```

    ## [1] 2878   72

### General Approach

I will use `R` and `Regex`(regular expressions) to clean the address
field of the publication to extract the affiliations of the authors.
Then I will use the `d3graph` library of `Python` to produce a dynamic
network of university collaboration.

### Use Regex to clean the data

Now, that we have the put together the files, its time to extract the
data from the `Addresses` field. Looking closely at this column:

``` r
csvs$Addresses[1:3]
```

    ## [1] "[Muehlematter, Urs J.] Univ Zurich, Univ Hosp Zurich, Inst Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Daniore, Paola; Vokinger, Kerstin N.] Univ Zurich, Inst Law, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland"                                      
    ## [2] "[Fu, Xiangzheng; Cai, Lijun; Zeng, Xiangxiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zou, Quan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China"
    ## [3] "[Raissi, Maziar; Karniadakis, George Em] Brown Univ, Div Appl Math, Providence, RI 02912 USA"

It is clear that this string has pattern in which the authors are
surrounded by square brackets, for instance `[Muehlematter, Urs J.]`,
and intermediately after the record reports the university
`Univ Zurich`. If the article is publish by two or more different
universities the field will be separated by a `;` semicolon.

``` r
# First we aim for separaing authors:
samp <- unlist(strsplit(csvs$Addresses[2], "; \\[" ))
samp
```

    ## [1] "[Fu, Xiangzheng; Cai, Lijun; Zeng, Xiangxiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China"
    ## [2] "Zou, Quan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China"

``` r
# Then we aim to extract the universities
samp <- gsub(".*\\] ", "",  samp)
samp
```

    ## [1] "Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China"                 
    ## [2] "Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Inst Fundamental & Frontier Sci, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China"

``` r
# We have to clean everything after the comma
samp <- gsub(",.*", "",  samp)
samp
```

    ## [1] "Hunan Univ"                     "Univ Elect Sci & Technol China"

### Build the dataframe publication-university

Perfect, now we apply this to the whole dataset. We have to give the
universities a unique identifier if they collaborate in the same
publication.

``` r
ml_data <- list()
i <- 1L
for (i in 1L:nrow(csvs)) {
  temp <- unlist(strsplit(csvs$Addresses[i], "; \\[" ))
  temp <- gsub(".*\\] ", "",  temp)
  temp <- gsub(",.*", "",  temp)
  if(length(temp)>0){
    ml_data[[i]] <- data.frame(id=i, univ=temp)
  }
  }

ml_data <- rbindlist(ml_data)

# We have 13074 in total
dim(ml_data) 
```

    ## [1] 13074     2

``` r
# Subset only to the top 50 universities
ml_data <- ml_data[univ %in% names(sort(table(ml_data$univ), decreasing = T)[1:50]),  ] 
```

## The edgelist

The edgelist is the key input that we need to plot the network. However,
we have to perform additional data manipulation before we have a list of
pairs of universities. The data so far contains pairs of
`c(publication, university)`, however, what we really need is a list
that contains pairs of universities when they work together in a project
`c(university, university)`. The article by RPubs (2022), describes more
about this type of conversion from the theoretical angle. From the data
science perspective, I show here Gonzalez-Sauri (2022) several ways to
perform this transformation.

``` r
ml_data
```

    ##         id                           univ
    ##    1:    2 Univ Elect Sci & Technol China
    ##    2:    4                            MIT
    ##    3:    4              Northwestern Univ
    ##    4:    7               Chinese Acad Sci
    ##    5:    8 Univ Elect Sci & Technol China
    ##   ---                                    
    ## 2661: 2873                   Tianjin Univ
    ## 2662: 2873            Natl Univ Singapore
    ## 2663: 2875                     Wuhan Univ
    ## 2664: 2875                 Univ Cambridge
    ## 2665: 2877            Univ Calif Berkeley

``` r
edge_lst <- merge(ml_data, ml_data, by = "id", allow.cartesian = TRUE)
edge_lst <- edge_lst[edge_lst$univ.x != edge_lst$univ.y, -1L]
dim(edge_lst)
```

    ## [1] 6594    2

I want to differentiate the strength of the link or edge, so, I will
calculate the betweenness centrality at the level of the edge. I will
append this to the dataset and then export it to a csv-file.

``` r
g1 <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(edge_lst, directed = F)
edge_lst[, weight:= edge.betweenness(g1)] 
setnames(edge_lst, c("source", "target", "weight")) 
fwrite(edge_lst, "edge_lst.csv")
```

## Top Universities in Machine Learning

Just for curiosity lets look at the top 20 universities working in the
field of Machine Learning.

``` r
top_ml <- sort(table(ml_data$univ), decreasing = T)[1:20]
top_ml <- data.frame(top_ml)
colnames(top_ml) <- c("univ", "pubs")

p <- ggplot(top_ml, aes(x = univ, y = pubs, fill = pubs)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
    angle = 45,
    #vjust = 0.5,
    hjust = 1
  ))

# save the picture
ggsave(file="top_ml_univ.svg", plot=p, width=16, height=10)

p
```

## Python Dynamic Network

For the network, I will use the `d3graph` library created by Taskesen
(2022).

``` python

import pandas as pd
from d3graph import d3graph, vec2adjmat

# Import data
df = pd.read_csv("./blog/edge_lst.csv")

# Show the input data
print(df)

# Create an adjaceny matrix
adjmat = vec2adjmat(source=df["source"].tolist(), target=df["target"].to_list())

# Initialize
d3 = d3graph()

# Build force-directed graph with default settings
d3.graph(adjmat)

# Show graph
d3.show()

```

The results are quite nice. First I would like to show the results
filtering universities that have 20 edges (co-authored publications) or
more.
