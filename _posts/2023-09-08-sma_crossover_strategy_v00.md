## Introduction

This post aims to explore the effectiveness of a straightforward Forex
market investment algorithm. Amidst numerous algorithmic possibilities,
I chose to embrace simplicity as a stepping stone before delving into
more complex strategies. Inspiration was drawn from Gurrib's 2016 paper,
published on ‘Global Review of Accounting and Finance,' available at
SSRN (<https://ssrn.com/abstract=2578302>). Gurrib's study, which
benchmarked a crossover simple moving average strategy on daily S&P500
candles between 1993 and 2014, reported an impressive 24% return over
1593 investment days. Let's embark on this journey to assess the
potential of a similar approach in the Forex market.
