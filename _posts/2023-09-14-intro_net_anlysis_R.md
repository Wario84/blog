# Introduction

This guide is divided into two parts. The first part provides a basic
introduction to the R programming language, while the second part
focuses on practical code snippets for creating network visualizations,
generating statistics and performing analysis using the igraph package.

# Section 1: An introduction to R.

## Getting Started with R

To become proficient in R, it’s helpful to think of coding in a way
similar to learning a language. Start with the fundamentals, which are
the basic operators. Operators are symbols that instruct the computer to
perform specific actions. For example, in `1 + 2`, the `+` operator
performs addition. In `a <- 1:5`, the `<-` operator assigns values.
Begin by familiarizing yourself with these operators; you don’t need to
memorize them all at once. Focus on the ones you encounter frequently,
and gradually expand your knowledge.
