## Introduction

In this blog entry, I will use data from Web of Science to draw a
network of collaboration in the field of Machine Learning. I am going to
disentangle the core universities that have published the top highly
cited `2878` articles about Machine Learning in Web of Science. These
are the most important scientific contributions to the field downloaded
in October 2022.

I use data of Web of Science which is the most widely used database of
research publications and citations. Most universities have a license to
use this database for research purposes. My query is simple, I use the
multidisciplinary Web of Science Core collection searching on the
publication’s Tittle, Abstract or Keywords the word “Machine Learning”.
Later I filter subsetting only the highly cited publications in the
field.
