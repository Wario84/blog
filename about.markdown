Welcome to my blog, my name is Mario H. Gonzalez-Sauri;

I apply econometric, bibliometric, network analysis and algorithms to study science systems, particularly in Latin America and Mexico. I'm interested in the analysis of science dynamics for development and policy making. My research focuses on estimating the impact of research collaboration and network structure on scientific productivity and impact. Furthermore, I study how the stratification of universities by prestige affects the future career of scholars.  My current research is centred on estimating the effect of foreign versus local PhD training and its effect on scientific achievement.
